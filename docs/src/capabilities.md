# Capability model

A capability is trusted executable policy registered by a host application.

Each descriptor declares:

- stable capability ID and version;
- execution scope;
- accepted selector shapes;
- typed parameter signature and defaults;
- required semantic/evidence capabilities;
- result and exactness contract.

Compilation rejects unknown capabilities, duplicate registrations, missing/extra parameters, invalid values and unsatisfied static contracts.

Execution is also fallible. `Runtime::run` rejects a plan if its runtime registry no longer contains every compiled capability; registry drift can never turn a rule into an implicit pass.

At runtime, missing evidence does not become a pass. `CapabilityEvaluation` carries conclusive findings separately from object- or rule-level not-evaluated outcomes. The runtime binds every such outcome to the compiled `RuleId`, sorts it deterministically, and exposes it through `Report::not_evaluated()`. Reasons distinguish an invalid declaration, a missing service, backend outage, incomplete evidence, invalid evidence, and resource exhaustion.

A capability may return findings and not-evaluated outcomes together when only part of its selected universe was computable. Consumers must not interpret an empty findings list as a pass while `not_evaluated` is non-empty.

## Built-ins

`axioval-rules` contains reusable, vendor-neutral implementations. Vendor identity, proprietary format handling, localized Solibri text and oracle-only ordering remain adapters in `vendor/solibri`.

`axioval:capability.property-exists`, `axioval:capability.property-required`, `axioval:capability.property-value-equals`, and `axioval:capability.property-predicate` resolve values through `PropertyResolutionServiceHandle`. The integer predicate accepts `equal`, `not_equal`, `greater_than`, `greater_or_equal`, `less_than`, and `less_or_equal`; failed predicates retain exact source evidence. A present value must be bound to the complete request—including its source-qualified object identity—and carry exact reviewable evidence. A missing value is conclusive only when the provider returns exact request-bound `CompletePropertyAbsenceEvidence`; service absence, partial extraction, cross-object substitution, mismatched responses, or inexact provenance remain not evaluated. Property selectors use the same resolver, so incomplete applicability data cannot silently skip an object. `property-exists` checks exact presence and intentionally does not reinterpret a present typed value. `property-required` applies the stronger required-value contract: exact absence, `null`, or blank text emits an evidence-backed finding, while booleans, integers, finite numbers/quantities, and nonblank text satisfy it. `property-value-equals` accepts a typed `property` reference and boolean `expected` value; a non-boolean resolution is invalid evidence rather than a pass or violation.

`axioval:capability.property-comparison` currently covers exact property-to-property targets with an independent selector-valued candidate scope, checked/shared/related modes, target-side factors, and `each` or `at_least_one` quantifiers. It compares booleans, strings, exact integers, finite decimals, and canonical quantities with matching dimensions. Missing properties emit evidence-backed missing-information findings; incompatible types or unavailable evidence remain not evaluated. Constant targets, `count`, and `sum` are deliberately rejected until their oracle fixtures and issue contracts land, so this registration is not a full Solibri parity claim.

`axioval:capability.free-floor-circle` and `axioval:capability.free-floor-rectangle` check whether each selected spatial scope can contain an exact supported vertical shape. Circle parameters are `diameter_metres` and `height_metres`; rectangle parameters are `width_metres`, `length_metres`, and `height_metres`, all in canonical metres. Each request covers every other project object as a candidate obstacle and requires exact whole-base support on the selected scope with zero hidden gap. A complete exact no-placement proof emits the shape-specific `NO_FREE_FLOOR_SPACE_*` finding; missing services, backend outages, or invalid/incomplete evidence emit not-evaluated outcomes instead.

## Adding a capability

1. Define or reuse canonical schema concepts and parameters.
2. Add failing contract and behavior tests.
3. Implement policy only; put source interpretation in an adapter.
4. Declare all evidence requirements.
5. Add deterministic and missing-evidence tests.
6. Register in the built-in registry.
7. Record Solibri parity and cutover in the migration ledger when applicable.
